Folded is a drawing applicaiton where two users draw small pictures, alternating turns. Each time the user is given a description of what the last player drew and they are given the ability to describe what they are drawing. After they finish drawing this information is saved the next user gets the description of what was just drawn. At the end all of the drawings are tiled vertically in chronological order. Since players alternate, the description they recieve is what is draw above their drawing. The final image is a stiched together piece of what both users drew. By restrciting the knowledge and adding some miscommunication, the results can be humorous and quite silly.
