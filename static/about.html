			<h1>What is Folded?</h1>
			<p>
				Folded is a collaborative drawing game. Simply invite a friend to play and 
				start drawing back and forth. Users take turns drawing tiles which are placed
				vertically one after another. Since users alternate, players do not know what
				the other player has drawn above their drawing except for a vauge description
				given by the other player. To learn more about the game see our <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Folded is a project by Ben Charas, Tommy Doyle, and Jack Paparian for 15-237 @ Carnegie Mellon Univerity.
