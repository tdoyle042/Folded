			<h1>How to Play Folded</h1>
			<h2>How Does This Work?</h2>
			<p>
				Folded is a drawing game played with a friend. One person starts off, draws
				a picture and leaves a vague description of what they drew for the next person.
				The next person sees the vauge description and draws the next part of the
				picture, however, they cannot see what the previous player drew. Players
				alternate drawing and leaving a description 3 times and then players can
				see the final image, which is a vertical composition of all the pieces both
				players drew. Without knowing what your friends is exactly drawing, see what
				you end up with!
			</p>
			<h2>Invite A Friend!</h2>
			<p>
				To make a new game, click invite a friend. In the text box next to it
				a url will be generated for you. Simply copy the url from the box and
				send it to a friend! Your friend will then be able to join you. Once a 
				friend has drawn, you will see the "Draw" button appear on your game page.
			</p>
			<h2>Draw A Picture!</h2>
			<p>
				The canvas is yours! You can use the drawing tools, located to the left of
				the canvas, to change the color and size of the brush. The first tool is
				brush size and the last tool is the color chooser. Above the canvas is the
				description your friend has sent. Below the canvas are buttons to clear
				the canvas, undo your last stroke, and redo your last stroke. Once you
				are done drawing, type in a vague description of what you drew and send!
			</p>
			<h2>Rinse and Repeat!</h2>
			<p>
				Draw back and forth with your friend. At the end you will be able to see
				the combine picture of both of your drawings!
